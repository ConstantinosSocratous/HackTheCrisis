# HackTheCrisis

We are developing the first Healthcare Telemedicine Application for Cyprus named Click A Doc. Click A Doc is designed both for safety and convenience allowing doctors to take care of their patients remotely from the comfort of their homes. Click A Doc is also a key response to the Covid -19 pandemic since it can offer a massive upgrade to the existing remote examination options that unfortunately leave many patients on the waiting lineâ€¦
<br>Click A Doc covers the entire patient journey, from first consultation, to diagnosis, to prescription and treatment and it incorporates the following features:
<br>1) Live Consultation with a doctor via chat or video, anytime anywhere helping reduce recovery time of patients by avoiding unnecessary commuting and queuing
<br>2) Medical history documented safely and securely including scans, appointment history and test results
<br>3) Check up scheduling using a live calendar allowing effective health management and planning tailored to each patient
<br>4) E- prescription service with information about prescribed medication online through partner pharmacies and the possibility to arrange medication deliveries to the patients door
<br>5) Data ownership/ safety to make sure each patient is the owner of their own data, allowing to determine who can or cannot access their medical records
<br>And we are also planning ahead! Click A Doc has the potential to offer Smart Symptom Documentation in an attempt to encourage preventative medicine through heart monitoring and other sensor detected information.
