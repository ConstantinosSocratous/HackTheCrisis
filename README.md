# HackTheCrisis

This is **CLICKADOC**. A tool that simply connects local healthcare with patients. 
<br>**CLICKADOC** covers the whole flow of the medical system and removes as much effort and movement as possible. 
<br>**CLICKADOC** is here to help healthcare providers to improve processes and put more information in the hands of their users - YOU.
<br>
<br>1) Schedule consultation with the doctors via chat or video call anytime anywhere.
<br>2) When you get transferred to another doctor, information like previous history, scans and results safely reaches your new doctor. 
<br>3) E-prescription service - that can be renewed digitally. 
<br>4) In connection to this, pharmacies allow you to order prescriptions online - door to door the same day delivery.
<br>5) CLICKADOC keeps full track of your medical history and sets reminders for check-ups tailored to your needs.
<br>6) While at the same time protecting your privacy by checking who is allowed to view your medical records. 
<br>7) The system also compiles data for national statistics, so that relevant ministries can measure health trends, track epidemics, and make sure that national health resources are spent wisely. 

<br>It's time to think about health. it's time to go digital. It's time to use CLICKADOC!
